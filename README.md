## Overview
    Traditional method of wildlife researching in Sri Lanka and many developing as
    well as developed countries is stay in wild areas for long time and seeing animals
    randomly and identify areas that animals are mostly active. This process takes longer
    time and researchers have to stay in the wild are throughout this longer time period.
    So, this is a hard process and sometimes their life is in danger because there is a
    probability to face an attack by wild animals while they are in jungle. And also, some
    animals are hiding when they sense that humans are around. Therefore, this method of
    observing or discovering certain animals is very ineffective for research work.
    A lot of time, money and human resources are spent in vain for traditional tracking
    of wild animals for researchers.

## Goals
-   Introduce a effective and efficient method for wildlife researchs.
-   Find a solution that saves time, money and lives of wildlife researchers.  

## Solution Architecture
    Our wildlife tracking system has camera traps and GPS location trackers. The motion
    sensors and pressure sensors are used to trigger the camera. Captures of the camera
    first saved in its own memory and they are also uploaded to the web server. And this
    system going to track and pinpoint areas where animals roam frequently, in real-time
    and give those locations to the user by using a map, the data observed by GPS trackers
    are used for accomplish this task. The location results will allow researchers to identify
    what are the areas that animals are highly active. The camera captures will help them
    to identify what kind of animals are roaming around particular area. Therefore,
    this will increase the chance of seeing animals for researchers, saving huge amounts
    of time as well as money, also it reduces the risk because this system allows remote monitoring.
    This system will also allow the users to see animal behavior in harsh environments.
